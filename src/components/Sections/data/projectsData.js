      "My portfolio website (this one) was built from scratch after conceptualizing the general layout. I had never seen a website built in this way before. Having at most built simple websites in both React and Vanilla JavaScript, I kinda just made it up as I went. Experimenting with various React animation libraries, I eventually settled on using React Spring for it's visual fluidity and overall speed and performance.",

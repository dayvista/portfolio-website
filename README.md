# Welcome to my portfolio website! 

It's functionality is rather self-explanatory. It was created using React, and the animations are powered by React Spring.

I'm proud of how much I learned about CSS, JavaScript, and React (and [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)) while coding this website.
In particular, what I would (and what I plan to) change is how I use a render-dependant technique to script animations with React Spring. That particular technique forces too many re-renders of app components and negatively impacts app performance. I would use the functional technique (explained [here](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/hooks/use-spring)) instead, as animations can be made even smoother.
